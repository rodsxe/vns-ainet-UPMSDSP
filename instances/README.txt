The instances used in the paper, 
"A robust multi-response VNS-aiNET approach for solving scheduling problems under unrelated parallel machines environments", 
is not property of the authors. 
In reason to that, only one instance of each type of criterion is avaliable 
here to make possible tests in the algorithm.
To get the complete set of instances, contact the authors of the original papers.
